# Dar al-Islam Jamaica Webpage

This is a demo webpage for Dar al-Islam Jamaica. The site was generated using Lektor, which is a Python-based static site generator. The site pages were originally written in Markdown (easy to use) and can be modified from an admin panel in the backend. The looks of the site can be adjusted as necessary by modifying a layout.html file and a style.css file in the backend. Inspiration was taken from sites showcased on the Lektor website.
